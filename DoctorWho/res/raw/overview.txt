Doctor who first aired in England in 1963, the same day 
President Kennedy was assassinated in the United States. 
In its third year the show hit a crises. The actor playing
the Doctor, William Hartnell, was in bad health and wanted
to leave the show. The writers ingeniusly came up with the 
idea that time lords could regenerate, become an entirely
different person while retaining the memories and some of the
characteristics of the past versions. The ploy worked and the
show aired continuously for 29 years. In the mid 80s, the show
was cancelled, though audio adventures and books continued.
in 1996 a movie aired on Fox TV, but failed to reboot the 
show. Finally in 2005 a new Doctor who series began, which 
incorporated the past series but still managed to be new. 
This time the reboot was a hit, and is now about to begin its
7th season of the new show or its 36th season overall.
